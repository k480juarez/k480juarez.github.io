                <p>Journaling is a priceless tool for self-reflection and self-improvement.<br>
                Successful people all over the world- those who consistently make positive changes
                in their lives- reflect daily and learn from their life experiences. And they often
                use some kind of journal to accomplish this. For the longest time, I knew the value
                of journaling- I heard the success stories of others- and yet I never took action.
                Why? Because I thought I didn't have enough time for it. I was "too busy". That was,
                until my ongoing negligence led to heightened levels of stress that literally put me
                in a hospital (my life was so disorganized and hectic, I started having panic attacks).
                I learned the hard way, but <strong>YOU</strong> don't have to.
                Journaling was my first step to getting back on track. And it was a life-saver.
                If you want to get somewhere in life, you need a map, and your journal is that map.
                You can write down what you did today, what you tried to accomplish, where you made mistakes, 
                and so much more. It's a place to reflect. It's a place to capture important thoughts.
                It's a place to sort out where you've been and where you intend to go. And it's one of the most underused,
                yet incredibly effective tools available to the masses.
                If you're interested in getting started with journaling, or if you'd like some fresh
                ideas for your current journaling practice, I've listed 31 journaling prompts below that I've
                personally used in the past to nudge myself into self-reflection. They will bring awareness
                to the subconscious beliefs and assumptions you have. And they will help you think through situations,
                big and small, and make better decisions.</p>

                <p class="h2Headers"><strong>Challenge yourself to read and write on each prompt for at least ten minutes every morning for the next month (roughly 31 days). See how doing so gradually changes your life...</strong></p><hr><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Day 1</strong></li><br>

                    <p>Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you made, for the times you lacked understanding, for the choices that hurt others and yourself. Forgive yourself, for being young and reckless. These are all vital lessons. And what matters most right now is your willingness to grow from them.<br>
                    <i>What specifically do you need to forgive yourself for? What have your error(s) in judgement taught you?</p></i><br>

                    <li><strong>Day 2</strong></li><br>

                    <p>The mind is your battleground. It's the place where the fiercest conflict resides.
                        <i>What's one thought that has been getting the best of you lately? How has it been influencing your behaviour?</i>
                    </p><br>

                    <li><strong>Day 3</strong></li><br>

                    <p>What you focus on grows. Stop managing your time. Start managing your focus. 99% of what stressed you out recently won't even matter a month from now.<br>
                        <i>What is truly worth focusing on today? What is <strong>NOT</strong>?</i>
                    </p><br>

                    <li><strong>Day 4</strong></li><br>

                    <p>Happiness is letting go of what you assume your life is supposed to be like right now, and sincerely appreciating it for everything that it is. So, <strong>RELAX</strong> . Breathe deep... let go, ande just live right now in the moment.<br>
                        <i>What do you appreciate most about your life right now? Why?</i>
                    </p><br>

                    <li><strong>Day 5</strong></li><br>

                    <p>A tiny part of your life is decided by uncontrollable circumstances, while the vast majority of it is decided by your internal responses. Let this sink in. Regardless of what is going on around you, peace of mind arrives the moment you come to peace with what is on your mind.<br>
                        <i>What is one reality you need to come to peace with? Why?</i>
                    </p><br>

                    <li><strong>Day 6</strong></li><br>

                    <p>It's funny how we outgrow what we once thought we couldn't live without, and then we fall in love with what we didn't even know we wanted. Don't be afraid. Have faith. Find the lessons. Trust the journey.<br>
                        <i>What's something you've let go that once meant the world to you? And, what's someting you love today that you never even knew you needed in your life?</i>
                    </p><br>

                    <li><strong>Day 7</strong></li><br>
                    
                    <p>Most of the time you have a choice. If you don't like a changable aspect of your life, it's time to start making changes and new choices. And IT'S OK to be low-key about it. You don't need to put everything on social media. Silently progress and let your actions speak for themselves. 

                        - Over the past month, what have your actions been silently saying about your priorities? Are there any changes you want to make? If so, elaborate.
                    </p><br>
                    <li><strong>Day 8</strong></li><br>
                        <p>We waste our time waiting for the ideal path to appear. But it never does. Because we forget that paths are made by walking, not waiting. And no, you shouldn't feel more confident before you take the next step. Taking the next step is what builds your confidence.

                        <br>
<i>
                        - What's the next step you've been thinking about taking, for far too long?
                    </p></i>
                    <li><strong>Day 9</strong></li><br>
                    <p>The next step means nothing if you are in love with your comfort zone and simply walking in circles. Don't live the same day 30,000 times and call it a life! Growth begins today, at the end of your comfort zone. Dream. Attempt. Explore. This moment is the doorway to anything you want.
